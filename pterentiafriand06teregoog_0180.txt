178 APPENDIX

483. ΒΟ DEG: sac istaec ut laven C¹P, Donat, Edd.: ista;
Schol. Bemb. Ad. 3. 4. 36, Fleckeisen, Fairclough: istam. The
active lavet seems absurd, since Glucerium was in no condition to
help herself. Menander, at any rate, did not make her attend to her
own needs; for his text, as recorded by Donatus was hoioor’
αὒτὴναῦτίκα. The passive lavetur, which originally stood here,
ι was, we may suppose, understood by some scribe as a middle form;
hence he carelessly substituted latet. It is probable that istaec is
the correct form of the pronoun; for the copyists would be more
likely to change this to ista than vice versa. The retention of is-
taec compels us to omit ut. The reading lavetur makes unnecessary
Fleckeisen's alteration of post to poste. (Engelbrecht, Wien.
stud. 5. 218, avoided poste by employing lavetur as a middle form.)
If the molossus in the fourth foot of a bacchiac tetrameter is held to
be impossible (see Lindsay, Tlte Captivi os Plautus page 83), one
may read: sac istam ut lave'nt ,· poste deinde.

512. With much hesitation l have adopted Fleckeisen’s jaciam
instead of the facio of the Mss. Possibly a misunderstanding of the
archaic qui induced some copyist to change the mood of the verb.
The alternative is to read quis.

527. The Mss. are divided between ipse and ipsus. The form
which was less familiar to the copyists is likely to have been the
original. The fact that Terence sometimes chose ipsus for metrical
reasons is not evidence that he avoided it wherever ipse would serve
as well. μ

596. 80 Mss. The proceleusmatic, corrtgtrt milri, seems to be

without an exact parallel, but nevertheless Klotz, Altrdmisclre
Metrik 268, is inclined to prefer this to the transposition which
Fleckeisen proposed in his first edition. Spengel's corrigi is scarcely ,
Latin3 the infinitive with subject accusative after enitor ought to be
in indirect discourse as it is after nitor in Cic, Ac. 2. 21. 68 : Nitamur
igitur niltil posse percipi.
’ 599. So Bentley; Mss.: quae tibi. Anaccent on tibiis almost
·inevitable in view of the contrast with illi. Terence was fond of
putting a connective immediately before its verb; but later usage
favored the transposition which appears in our manuscripts. Corn·
pare my note on ut (160).
