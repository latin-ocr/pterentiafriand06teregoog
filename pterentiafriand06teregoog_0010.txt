6 PREFACE

In determining the text the editor has followed Spengel,
Pease, and Fairclough in rating the manuscripts of the γ
group above those of the δ group.

The editor has advanced several conjectures and interpre-
tations of his own, and has accepted a number of theories
that have not yet won general approval. lt would be foolish
to put any of these before the public apart from the reasons
on which they are based. Consequently the text and stage
, directions are defended at several points in an Appendix,
and some items in the commentary are discussed in foot-
’ notes. Both Appendix and footnotes, then, are frankly
intended, not for students, but for teacbers. Therefore, in
justice to those who will purchase the book, both have been
made as brief as possible. If a reading or an interpretation
is adequately defended in one of the standard editions,
the argument is not repeated here. ln searching for justifi-
cation of the text, readers are advised to turn first to Fair-
clough’s edition; for our text resembles his somewhat more
closely than it does any other that has appeared.

lt is hoped that teachers will approve the use of the charac-
ters U and v in the manner usual in editions of later writers.
Meaning'less variation between editions in such matters ,
is very misleading to students; as witness the young woman
who had noticed no feature of Tacitus’ style except his
avoidance of capital letters.

ln the commentary the editor has tried not to tell so much
that nothing would be left for the teacher to say. For
example, many familiar comments on the construction of ¹the
plot have been intentionally omitted in the belief that the
student does not need them while preparing his lesson, and
that no competent teacher is likely to overloolr them. Some

may miss a reference to the matter of “redende Namen’';
but the editor doubts whether there really are any such in,
Terence.
