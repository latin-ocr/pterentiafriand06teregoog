but most words seem to have varied freely between the two
pronunciations.1

The ,early dramatists rellect this situation in their verse.
Almost any iambic succession of syllables with an accent next
.to the long syllable may be treated as two short syllables,
but the frequency with which the shortened form of each
word occurs reflects roughly the usage of ordinary speech.²

ln Plautus and Terence there occur a number of shortened
iambi which do not seem to have aword or sentence accent on
the syllable preceding or following the shortened syllable,
and in some of these the shortened syllable itself seems to be
accented. lt is possible that in some cases our information
as to early Latin accent is defective, but most such irregulari-
ties are probably due to the influence of related words which
fulfilled the conditions of the change; tibique is due, then,
to tibi, ne'scid (340, etc.) to scih, ddvenls (909) to alnis, eddem
(885) to Ε’ὄ, edrum (64, etc.) to idru'mque and ἔὸνάπᾶιηι,
fuisse (42) to such forms as fril, salisse'mun and fdlstique, ·
ddccinist (236, etc.) to liic ist, etc.

Many scholars think that the verse ictus had the same
tendency as the accent of ordinary speech to shorten the long
syllable of an iambus. lt is at least true that a syllable
shortened by the iambic law rarely stands under the
ictus.³

20. In general, Terence makes the same use of elision as
the later poets. Hiatus occurs after· interjections, e.g., ὅ
hominem (769); and occasionally at a change of speakers,
as in line 593.

¹Some scholars would prefer to say “were pronounced with a quantity
intermediate between long and short.”
