driving Stapula‚¹ his old slave woman, out of the house.

“Clear out, Ι say, come, clear out; you’ve got to go out of Δ

doors‚ you pop-eyed spy.'’ After twenty lines of threats he
takes us into his confidente. “l’m sure Ι never saw a worse
crook than this old woman, and I’m desperately afraid she’ll
play me a trick or find out where the gold is hid ; for the
wretch has extra eyes in the back of her head. Now l’ll
go and see whether the gold is where Ι put it.’'

Presently he returns.

Eucl. [To himself] Ι didn’t sweep away my worries and
come out till Ι saw that everything in the house was sale.
[To Stapula.] Now go in and stay on guard.

Stapula. Really? On guard in there? So that no one
shall steal the house? For we haven’t anything else that's
worth a thief’s trouble; the place is full of emptiness and
cobwebs.

Eucl. lt's a wonder Jupiter wouldn't make me a king
Philip or Darius just for your sake, you witch ! Ι want those
cobwebs guarded. Lock the door'with two bolts. l'll be
back presently. [Exit stapam] lt’s torture to me to leave
my house; but Ι understand how Ι have to behave. The
chief of our curia promised to distribute a nummus to each of
us; if Ι fail to go after it, Ι suppose everybody will immedi-
ately suspect that Ι have a pot of gold at home, for it doesn't
look reasonable for a poor man to despise a little cash 3ηά so
not go to get his nummus. They’re suspicions already. l'm
going where Ι started to, and then l'll come back home as
soon as Ι can.

On his return heis met by his rich neighbor Megadorus

Meg. Good morning, Eucli03 Ι hope luck is coming your
way.
