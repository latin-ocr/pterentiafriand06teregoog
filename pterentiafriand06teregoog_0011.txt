As already implied, the editor is under great obligation to

Ἴ Fairclough’s excellent edition of the Andria. He has also

taken not a little from Ashmore and from the standard

¹ German editions. Thanlrs are also due to the publishers ol
³ Capps' From Homer to Theocritus (Scribners, New York)
Ἴ and of Murray's translation of the Iphigenia in the Land

os the Tauriani (George Allen, London)‚ as well as to the
authors themselves, for permission to reprint extracts from Ἴ
those books. Professor Capps had the kindness to read

Ἴ most of the Introduction in manuscript, and he made
¹ several valuable suggestions. Professor Knapp subjected

the entire manuscript to a searching criticism, which led in
some cases to a change ol opinion and in very many others to
a clearer statement of the view previously adopted. There
is scarcely a page ol the commentary· that has not been
improved in one way or the other. He has also read most of

the prool. ’ ·
