228 ff, For the trochaic septe-
narii, see Introduction ²4 and 2 5.

228. Arculis: the classical
form would be Archylis (Gk.
Ἀρχυλῖς).

2²9· phl llln: lor the scan-
sion, see Introduction 19.—
temulentn: this epithet pre-
pares the way lor compotrix
(232), and thus provides a
motive for Arculis' insisting
that Lesbia be employed. It
appears, however, that Lesbia
is not in her cups thismorning.
The second epithet‚ temeraria,
is amply justified by the mid-
wife’s behavior when she arrives.

²31· aniculae: the diminu-

tive expresses contempt, as
diminutives often do. ·

²³3· pariundi: ·nnd- for -end-
in the gerund and gerundive of

the third and fourth conjuga· l

tions is more common in early

than in classical Latin. Prob- .

ably u was the original vowel,
while e was brought in by the
influente of the present active
participle. - aliis is feminine.
234. exanimatum: ‘⁴ out of
breath.''-siet: in addition
to the classic'al forms of the
present subjunctive of sum,
early Latin had also the longer
forms siem, siis, siet, silmas,
sinis, sient. They were going
out of use in Terence's day.
235. turbu: “agitation.''
