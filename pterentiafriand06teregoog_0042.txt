TERENCE

10. Terence, who began his writing at this time, revolted
against so inartistic an ideal, and appealed to the freedom of
’ adaptation which had been practiced by Plautus and the
other famous comic poets of the past. He did not, however,
revert ¹to the unrestrained license of Plautus. He altered
freely wherever he felt that the Greek dialogue was inappro-

κ priate for‘the Roman stage, buthe carefully preserved the

Greek atmosphere and the Greek setting. The coins and
magistrates mentioned by him are almost always Greek3
we are no longer called upon to naturalize‘a Lar familiaris in
Athens.

ln those aspects of their work which were necessarily
original, their language and style, the differente between
Plautus and Terence is quite as wide. The earlier poet was
fond of the exaggerated slang, personal abuse, ingenious
oaths, and brazen obscenity everywhere to be found in the Ι
language of the lowest strata of society. Terence, too„
employs colloquial Latin, but his characters usually speak
as gentlemen might. Even his slaves are guilty of no such
linguistic excesses as abound in Plautus.

11. lf, however, one has read only the formal Latin of
Caesar, Cicero's Orations, Vergil, Livy, and Horace’s Odes,
the novel and striking feature of Terence’s language and
style will be precisely their colloquial coloring. This appears
most clearly in the brevity of the sentences and their lack of
periodic structure-the language is not “bookish.'’ Α
