INTRODUCTION 31

The earliest Roman comedies were adaptations of Greek
plays of the New Comedy. The first of these was written
by Lucius Livius Andronicus, a native of Tarentum who had
been brought to Rome as a slave. At the ludi Romani in
240 ne. he presented a Latin tragedy and a Latin comedy,
both translated from the Greek. It is thought that the .
innovation was in honor of the successful termination of the
first Punic War in the preceding year. The experiment was
successful, and adaptations of Greek plays soon became a
regular feature not only of the ludi Romani in September, but
also of the ludi plebeii in November, the ludi Megalenses in
April, and the ludi Apollinares in July. Dramatic exhibitions
might also be given on special occasions, such as a triumph
or the funeral of a distinguished man.

7. Since the Roman audiences had had no such long and
intimate acquaintance with good literature as the Greek poets

could always count upon, and since the Greek manners
represented in the comedies were of course unfamiliar at

Rome, many modifications were necessary in order to make
'the plays intelligible there. Some of the changes seem to our
more sophisticated taste very strange indeed. As their
hearers had no interest in local color or historic accuracy, the
poets did not hesitare to make their Greek characters use
metaphors based upon peculiarly Roman customs and allude
to Roman magistrates and places in the city of Rome as if
’ these belonged to the Greek town in which the scene was laid.
Sometimes the Latinization of Greek terms is so careless as
to be ambiguous; thus nummus is used to represent several
different Greek coins -much as if we should Americanize
the English “five pounds'’ and “five shillings” alike hythe
phrase “five dollars.'' It was found, too, that the popular
taste was tickled by a liberal admixture of broad Italian wit.
