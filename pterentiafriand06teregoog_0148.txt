TERENTI ANDRIA

Scio, quid sonere. Da. Hoc ego tibi prolecto effectum 20

reddam.

Pa. lam hocopus est. Da. Quin iam habeo. Ca. Quid est? .

Da. Huic, non tibi habe03 ne estes

⁴ 705Ca: Sat habeo Pa. Quid facies? Cedo. Da. Dies hic

mi ut satis sit, vereor ¹
Ad agendum3 ne vocivom minc me esse ad narrandum

credas.

Proinde hinc vos amolimin13 nam mi inpedimento estis. ’

Ρα. Ego hanc visam. [Exit into Gluccrium’s house] Da. 2⁵
Quid tu? Quo hinc te agis? Ca. Verum vis
dicam? Da. Immo etiam

703. effectum reddam: for the
idiom, see on missum face (680).

¹704. quin, “why not?” was
so commonly used in rhetorical
questions which amounted to
emphatic assertione, that it
came to be a corroborative
particle, “ really, indeed.”—-
ne erres: a prohibition, “ don't
make any mistake.”¹

705. cedo here retains its
long ultima3 see on 150. Others
assume that the ultima was al-
ways short in Terence's day,
and read crdtbeforethediaeresis.
- ut belongs with vereor.

706. ne eredas: for the con· 1

struction, see on ne erres (704)
-voeivomz consult the dic-
tionary under the classical form
vacuus.

707. Under the circum·
stances, Davos’ insolence serves
to increase the young men’s con·
fidence in him.

708. immo etiam: the words
go closely with the following
line, and have the same un-
favorable connotation as in
line 65 ς ; translate “Worse yet !'’
or better, “ That isn’t the worst

of it.”²

lMost scholare consider this and accredas (706) clauses of purpose; but
Bennett, Syntax of Early Latin 1. 168, classifies as prohibitive the closely
similar clauses in Plautus, Capr. 186, Merc. 528, and Mil. 1422. Certainly
the clause is more effective as a prohibition.

²lf one translates “yes, of course,'' it is hard to see why Carinus doesn't
tell his story. The same consideration makes it impossible to talre the first

patrol line 709 as an aside.
