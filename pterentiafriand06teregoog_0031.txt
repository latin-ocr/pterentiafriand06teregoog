and have often spoken with her - first go and talk to her;
take her my message, l beg you. ,

Pol. But of course you are a good speaker, Pataecus?

Par. Fairly.

Pol. But really, Pataecus, you must be. That's the way

If l don't always do my best- Now if you'd only look at the
clothes she has —-

Pat. Oh! That's all right,

Pol. Do look at thern, Pataecus; you'll be sorrier forme.

Par. [Arida] Ye gods!

Pol. Come on! What clothes! How fine she looked
when she wore them! For l suppose you've never seen.

Pat. Yes, l have. ²

Pol. ¹And then she was so magnificently tall; but why do
I speak of that ἲ - fool that l arn to talk of ‘things that don't
matter.

Par. Oh! Not at all!

Pol. You think not? Well, at any rate you must see

Pat. Very well, l'll come. [Exeunt into Polemon's house]

versation with Glycera. She begs him to inspect the tokens
of her parentage which her foster mother gave her. After a
short lacuna in the text we find them examining some figures
embroidered on the elothing in which the babies were exposed.
Pataecus has made out one figure. “Isn't this a goat stand·
ing next, or an ox, or some such beast ?'’

Gly. lt's a stag, dear friend, not a goat!
Pat. At least it has horns, l know that much.
Gly. And this third?
