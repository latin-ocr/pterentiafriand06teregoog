Si senserit, perii; aut si lubitum fuerit, causam ceperit,
Quo iure quaque iniuria'r praecipitem in pistrinum dabit.
Ad haec mala hoc mi accedit etiam: haec Andria,

Si ista uxor sive amicast, gravida e Pampilost.
Audireque eorumst operae pretium audaciam ;

Nam inceptiost arn6ntium, haud amantium.

Quidquid peperisset, decreverunt tollere.

220 Et fingunt quandam inter se nunc fallaciam,

is the same dative that follows
malefacere, etc. y
213. perii: a very common

bit of slang, ‘⁴ I'm done for.'’ -
ceperit: in early Latin the
future perfect often has its
original force of a slightly
emphatic future; see Bennett,
Syntex of Early Latin 1. 54 ff.
Compare the use of the pluper·
fect as a simple past tense,
which we have noticed in
provideram (183).

214. quo iure quaque iniuria:
the antecedent of quo and qua is
causam, “according to which
justice and (it may be> injus-
tice ”3 translate “and s0,
justly or unjustly.'’

217. ebrum: for the short-
ening of the penult by the iam·
bic law, see Introduction 19
end. -operee pretium: “worth
while.''

21⁹· quidquid: for the neu-
ter referring to a person, see
on nil (120). - peperisset: sub-

junctive in a subordinate
clause in informal indirect dis-
course. — tollere: it lay within
the father’s discretion to have
a new-born babe exposed, as
Pataecus did in Menander's
Periceiromene (Introduction ς),
and in the present case Davos
thinks that any sane ¹father
would make away with the
child. lf on the other hand
the father decided to rear the
infant he lifted it in his arms,
and so the verb tollo came
to mean “acknowledge'' or
ss reah„

220 ff. As the sequel shows,
Glucerium and Pampilus know
that the story is actually true,
although they are notin a posi-
tion to prove it. Davos, how·
ever, is in the habit of getting
out of difficulties per fallaciam,
and ‘he suspects them of at-
tempting the same thing.

220. inter se: for the accent,
see on apud me (36).
