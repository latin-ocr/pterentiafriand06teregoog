ACTUS IV, SCENA IV

151

Eho Musis, puer hic undest? Quisve huc attulit?
Mu. Satin sanu’S, qui me id rdgites? Da. Quem ego igitur 10

rogem,

Qui hic neminem alium videam? Cr. [Asida] Miror,

unde sit.

Da. Dictura’s quod rogo? [Threatens Musis.] Mu. Au!
Da. [Whispersl Concede ad dexteram.
Mu. Deliras3 n6n tute ipse. . .? Da. [Aloudl Verbum

si mihi

Unum praeter quam quod te rogo faxis, cavel

haec is made clear in the next
line.

⁷4⁹· satin is the colloquial
form of satis-ne,· for the loss
of s, see on censen (256).
Satis heremeans “quite‚” as
it often does.

750. Davos seizes the oppor-
tunity to make Cremes believe
that his presence has not been
noticed.

751. Davos threatens Musis
in order to convince Cremes that
they are really enemies. Her
exclamation of fear is precisely
what he wants; but at the
same time she draws away from
him toward Cremes. Hence

time to cut off a dangerous
verb.

753. laxls is an early Latin
future, equivalent to facies.l
The tense is conjugated in the
same way as a present of the
third conjugation. Histori-
cally the formation is parallel
with the future in Greek
(δείξω, etc), which is in
origin the subjunctive of an
aorist (ἔδειξαἸ etc). Oscan
and Umbriam two Italic dia· ,
lects closely related to Latin,
form their future in the sam'e
way. From the same (aorist)
stem fan, early Latin forms a
subjunctive (with present force)

the whispered command that sax-im, which is conjugated

follows.
752. for a second time
Davos’ interruption is just in

like sim, and was, like sim,
originally an optative. Both
formations are far less common

¹ Plautus seems to use the form in the sense of the future perfect some·
what more often than he does the regular future ; but the future sense is

also common.
