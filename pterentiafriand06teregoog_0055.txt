METER AND PROSODY

16. The basic foot of the majority of Terence’s verses is
the iambus (oL), The long syllable may be resolved into
two shorts with the ictusl upon the first of them, thus giving
the tribraeh (υ (ω) with the ictus on the second syllable. For
the iambus may be substituted the spondee (Α) with the
ictus on the second syllable.² Either or both of the syllables
of the spondee may be resolved into two shorts, and, as in the
case of the iambus, if the ictus syllable is resolved, the ictus
falls upon the first of the resulting shorts. Hence we lind the
anapaest (υ υ L), the dactyl (Aa υ), and the proceleusmatic '
(υ υ (κ υ). Terence employs, then, in iambic verses these
six kinds of feet:

*iambus υ l-
tribrach υ (κ υ
spondee μέ

anapaest υ υί
dactyl -6 υ
proceleusmatic υ υ 6 υ

In view ol the difficulty of reading rapidly verses which allow
so much variation, each ictus is marked in this edition except
in cases where it falls upon the final syllable of the verse.³

¹ The word “ ictus ’' denotes the beat used in marking time. The editor
assumes that the syllable which the ictus accompanied was accented
whether it would have been accented in prose or not.

² Such a spondee must be pronounced with each of its two syllables about
three fourths as long as an ordinary long syllable, so as to occupy
approximately the time of an iambus. Similarly‚ each of the syllables of
a dactyl, an anapaest, and a proceleusmatic must be slightly shortened in
iambic and trochaic verse. Such feet are said to be irrational,

'To mark the ictus of an iambic close seems quite useless, and it would
encourage a heavy stressing of the final syllable, a pronunciation as foreign
to the Latin language as it is to English.
