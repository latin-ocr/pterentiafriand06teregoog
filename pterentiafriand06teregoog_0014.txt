INTRODUCTION

OLD ATTIC COMEDY

2. The earliest, and in fact the only, Greek comic poet
from whom we have complete plays is Aristophanes, who
lived in Athens from about 444¹ to 386 nc. We may illus·
trate the early period of Athenian comedy‚ the so-called
Old Attic Comedy, by an account osone of his plays, The.

Birds.²

The scene is laid in awild, uninhabited country, with
a bunch of shrubbery in the background. Enter two Athe-
nians, Peithetaerus (Plausible) and Euelpides (Hopeful).
They carry birds on their hands to guide them to a region
where they will be free from the troubles of Athenian life.

υ “For we,'' they say,

Have deemed it fitting to betake ourselves
To these our legs, and make our person scarce.
Not through disgust or hatred or disdain

Of our illustrious birthplace, which we deem
Glorious and free; with equal laws ordained
For fine and forfeiture and confiscation,

With taxes universally diffused3

And suits and pleas abounding in the Courts.
For grasshoppers sit only for a month'
Chirping upon the twigs; but our Athenians
Sit chirping and discussing all the year, ,
Perched upon points of evidence and law.
Therefore we trudge upon our present travels,
With these our sacrificial implements,

To seek some easier unlitigious place,
Meaning to settle there and colonize.

ιΙ owe this date to Professor Edward Capps.
