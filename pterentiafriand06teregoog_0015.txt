They reach the home of Hoopoe (represented in the
scemry), who answers their summons. The make-up o'f
the actor who represents Hoopoe is as grotesque as pos-
sible, and is frankly ridiculed by the visitors: “HeracleS,
what plumage! Are you a bird or a peacoclr?” The
scarcity of leathers upon his body is explained by Hoopoe
as due to the molting season. The lile of the birds, as
depicted by Hoopoe-no need of money, field sports‚
nothing to do but banquet in the gardens-seems so at·
tractive to Peithetaerus‚ the inventive genius, that he pro· ,
poses a scheme for the aggrandizement of the birds: “Build
a city in the air, between earth and heaven; intercept
the savor of the sacrifices which men make to the gods,
and thus¹ starve out the latter until they turn over the
sovereignty to the birds.’' “Odds nets and birdlime‚”
says'Hoopoe, “that’s a clever notion! l'm with you if
the other birds agree.” So he calls to his wife, Nightingale:

Awakel awalre!
Sleep no more, my gentle matel
With your tiny tawny bill,
Wake the tuneful echo shrill,
On vale or hill;
Or in her airy, rocky seat,
Let her listen and repeat
The tender ditty that you tell,
The sad lament‚
The dire event,
ι To luckless Itys that befell.
’ ’ Thence the strain
Shall rise again,
And soar amam,
Up to the lolty palace gate;
Where mighty Apollo sits in state;
