PREFACE

Tffls edition of the Andria is intended lor students who
are making their first acquaintance with ‘ancient drama. ln
the conviction that beginners cannot, as a sule, get from a
series of formal treatises the background needed for an in-
telligent reading of Terence, the editor has substituted brief
outlines of several Greek and Latin plays which illustrate
important stages in the development of comedy. A little
information has been interspersed between these extracts‚ ⁴
but it is hoped that there is no more of it than can be read
with interest and remembered with some accuracy. Most
information that is really pertinent can be given more
effectively in the notes.

Suetonius' Life of Terence, with a rather full commentary,
has been substituted for the usual biographical remarks in
English. The editor has found this more interesting and
’ valuable to read with a class than a single prologue apart
from the needed context that is to be found in the other six.
The text of the b'iography is in the main that of Wessner's
edition of Donatus.

The usual analysis of the plot of the Andria has been
omitted so as not to lessen the students' interest in the play
itself.

lt seemed impossible to relegate the tre'atment of meter
and prosody to the notes, and so there is a brief essay on
these subjecto The material is not arranged systematically‚
but is given in the order in which the student is likely to
need it.
