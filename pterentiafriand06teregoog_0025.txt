mmomrcrrorv 21 ·

My thoughts had tumed. Speak on. - No need
Ι To qiiitiiin: we shall hear things marvelous.

. Tell him that Artemis my soul did save,

. Ι wot not how, and to the altar gave

A fawn instead; the which my father slew,
Not seeing, deeming that the sword he drew
Struclr me. But she had borne me far away
And left mein this land. -Ι charge thee, say
So much. It all is written on the scroll.

. An easy charge thou layest on my soul,

A glad oath on chine own, Ι wait no more,

But here fulfill the service that Ι swore.
Orestes, take this tablet which Ι bear ·

To thine own hand, thy sister’s messenger.

. Ι take it, but Ι reck not of its scrip

Nor message. Too much joy is at my lip.
Sister! Beloved! Wildered though Ι be,
My arms believe not, yet they crave for thee.
Now, filled with worrder, give me my delight!
[H c goes to embrace lter. She stands speechless.]
Stranger, forbear! No living man hath right
Τό touch that robe. The goddess were defiledl

. Ο sister mine, Ο my dead father’s child,
ι Agamemnon’s chi1d; take me and have no sear,

Beyond all dreams 'tis Ι thy brother here.

. My brother? Thou? . .. Peace! Mock at me

no more.
Argos is bright with him and Nauplia's shore.

. Unhappyone! Thou hast no brother there.

. Orestes . . . thou? Whom Clytemnestrabare?
. To Atreus' first-born son, thy sire and mine.

. Thou sayst it: oh, give me some proof, some sign Ι
. What sign thou wilt. Askanythingfromhome.
