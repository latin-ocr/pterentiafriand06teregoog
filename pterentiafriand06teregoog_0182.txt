180 APPENDIX

Andriast in the Mss.). Meretrix is needed to give Cremes a clue to

Musis' identity. The undeserved insult in it would hardly fail to
drawa retort from Musis, and so Ι assign 757 f. to her instead ol to
Davos as the Mss. do. Compare note ad loc.

772. Mss. : caius. This is said to be the only case in Terence of
the dissyllabic genitive of qai. There is no doubt, however, that
the form was in common use3 and so it is quite unnecessary to read
quoia here.

787. So Mss. (credes, ΒΡ). Fleckeisen’s attempt to dismiss
noa credar as a “soleci·sm’' (Neue Jahrb. 139. 844) is scarcely suc·
cessful. He does not explain how aon got into our Mss. For
approximate parallels, see Bennett, Syatax of Early Latia 1. 170.

807. D: haciaeappali; cett: hacmrappali; Priscian and one
of Bentley's manuscripts: hac mr attali. It seems impossible to
explain the presence of appuli in our manuscripts if attali was the
original form3 and yet me appuli is without parallel (see Fairclough).
l thinlr that hac me is a corruption of the emphatic hacine of D,
which is itself an early modification of huc.

816. 3: libeu- γε licet. Crito is making a virtue of necessity,
and licet would destroy the point. Compare my note. '

817. On the assignment of parts, see Spengel's critical note, and
compare my note. Ἴ

838. ln the Mss. at stands at the beginning of the following line.
See Vahlen, Uber dir V erssclrltlsre ia dra Komr'r'dira des Terentius.

850. The reading in the text is Dziatzlro's. I cannot agree with
Spengel and Fairclough when they hold that modo must be an em-
phatic word here. Davos is speaking against his will and does not
care to emphasize anything. Simo seizes upon the modo in *his
reply, not because it is emphatic, but because it is the only new

element in Davos' statement. For iambic rgo, see Appendix on 258. .

854. So BDP; Edd.: audies. The subjunctive certainlyoccurs
afterjaxo; e.g., Phor. 1028. See Bennett, Syatax ο] Early Latin 1.
mildi. For rgd, see Appendix on 258.

909. So BDEGP²C², Fleckeisen3 Peo‚Edd.: quare. The fuller

reading gives a better sense, and the corruption to qua re is very easy.
926. See Klotz, ad loc.
