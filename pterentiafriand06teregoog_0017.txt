INTRODUCTION

. Let me see them overpowered,
Hacked‚ demolished‚ and devoured3
Neither earth, nor sea, nor sky,

Nor woody fastnesses on high,
Shall protect them if they fly.

Peithetaerus and Euelpides hastily erect a barricade of
pots and pans, and propose to defend themselves; but
Hoopoe arranges a truce. The chorus retire to listen to the
envoys:

Back to the rear! resume your station,
Ground your wrath and indignation!
Sheathe your fury! stand at ease,
While Ι proceed to question these:
What design has brought them here?

Peithetaerus first proves by comic instantes that the birds,

and not the gods, were originally sovereign over all. He
then develops his plan:

Then Ι move that the birds shall in common repair
To a centrical point, and encamp in the air;
And intrench and inclose it, and fortify there:
And build up a rampart, impregnably strong,
Enormous in thickness, enormously long,

Bigger than Babylon3 solid and tall,

With bricks and bitumen, a wonderful wall.

As soon as the fabric is brought to an end,

A herald or envoy to Jove we shall send,

To require his immediate prompt abdication3
And if he refuses, or shows hesitation,

Or evades the demand, we shall further proceed,
With legitimate warfare avowed and decreed:
With a warning and notices, formally given,

To Jove, and all others residing in heaven,
