ful secret. She answers his first questions with an air of
injured innocence. When he tells her just what he has
seen, she refuses an explanation and simply demands that he·
believe her guiltless. ln his present distress of mind, aggra-
vated by drink, such an attitude seems to him proof of guilt.
In a lit of rage he drags the girl indoors‚ and slashes off her
beautiful hair with his sword. Repentance comes swiftly,
but it is Glycera's turn to be indignant3 and so Polemon
departs for the country in despair. Glycera takes refuge
with her kindly neighbors, Pataecus and Myrrhina, after
first learning that Moschion is not at home. ’ .
Then appears the goddess Agnoia, “Misapprehension.”
She tells how eighteen years ago Pataecus' first wife died in
giving birth to a boy and a girl. Pataecus learned on the
same day that he had been ruined by shipwreck, and, over·
whelmed by his double misfortune, ordered the children to be
exposed. “They were found‚'' the goddess continueS, “by a
poor woman, who kept the girl as her own child, but gave the
boy to a wealthy matron who now lives in this house (i.e.,
to Myrrhina), for she wanted a son. Some years passed;
the war persisted, the troubles of the Corinthians increased,
the old woman grew poorer still. The girl herself was grown
-it was she you saw a moment ago—and had a lover in
this impetuous young Corinthian. So the foster mother
gave her to him as herown daughter. But, already feeble
and seeing that her days were numbered‚ she told the girl
the truth and gave her the clothes she had found her in.
She also pointed out to Glycera the brother she had never

known (Moschion) : for she feared a time might come when ·

the girl would need help, and this was her only relative.

“Not long ago the soldier bought this house. But Glycera,
even though she lives next door to her brother, has not told
her secret3 she sees him prospering and doesn’t want to
drag him down.
