4. Non obscura fama est adiutum Terentium in scriptis a Laelio
et Scipione, eamque ipse auxit numquam nisi leviter refutare cona·
tus, ut in prologo Adelphorum: 5

Nam qu6d isti dicunt malevoli, homines nobiles

1. titulo: a strip of parch-
ment attached to the end of a
book roll and containing such
information as is given by a
modern title page.

nam introduces the reason
for some statement that* has
been lost from our text. ,

Adelphorum: the Adelploe
was the last play Terence pro-
duced.

2. Varro: M. Terentius
Varro, “the most learned of the
Romans,'' a contemporary of
Cicero He wrote approxi-
mately 620 books, of which
three, De Re Rustica, and six,
De Lingua Latina, survive.

Menandri: Terence's Adel-
pleoe is an adaptation of Menan-
der's play of the same name.
Menandri is brielly put for
Menandri Adelphorum.

. 3. non obscura fama est, eta:
the story was familiar in Sueto·
nius' day and had been for more
than a hundred years. Santra,
however, as quoted below by Sue-
tonius himself, shows not only

that the rumorwas false, but also
that the words here cited from
Terence cannot apply to it. Ap-
parently a story was started by
the poet's rivals that he had been
helped‘in his composition by
certain prominent statesmen-
perhaps those mentioned by
Santra. Terence referred to the
story without mentioning names
and refused to deny it. It was,
nevertheless, so completely dis-
believed and forgotten, that,
when the scholars of a later
day tried to interpret Terence’s
dark hints, they hit upon the
wrong persons. See also below
on pronuntiasse versus, etc, and
on quorum operam, etc.

5. prologo Adelphorum: lines
15-21. They are iambic senarii.

6. quod: “as to the lact
that.'' Others regard this as a
relative used exactly as quod two
lines below.

isti malevoli: Terence’s rivals,
in particular Luscius Lanuvinus,
on whom see Introduction 9.

7. hunc: Terence speaks of
