4. The New Attic Comedy which grew up in the latter
half of the fourth century uc. was the heir ol the tragedy of
Euripides no less than of the Old Comedy of Aristophanes

lt was like theOld Comedy in taking its characters from every· .

day life instead of from myths and in a certain freedom from

until recently we have had only such fragments of them as '
are contained in quotations by later writers Toward the
