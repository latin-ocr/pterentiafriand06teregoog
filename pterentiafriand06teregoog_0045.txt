INTRODUCTION 41

2. Hic cum multis nobilibus familiariter vixit, sed maxime cum
Scipione Africano et C. Laelio, quibus etiam corporis gratia con-
ciliatus existimatur. Quod et ipsum Fenestella arguit contendens
utroque maiorem natu fuisse, quamvis et Nepos aequales omnes
fuisse tradat et Porcius suspicionem de consuetudine per haec s

faciat ι

2. Scipione truteno: the
younger Africanus, the con-
queror of Carthage, born 185 or
184 uc. He was the center of
a band of literary men who
encouraged the newly intro-
duced Hellenic culture at Rome.
lt is sometimes stated that
Terence drew much of his inspi-
ration from this “ Scipionic
Circle,’' but it is not likely that
Scipio had gathered many prom-
inent men about him at the time
when Terence began writing;
for Scipio was then not more
than seventeen years old (see
on Caecili0,§ 3,and nondum . . .
annum, § 5).

C. Laelio: Gaius Laelius
Sapiens, the younger, born 186
rac. He and Africanus are the
young men with whom Cicero
makes Cato discuss old age in

Ι the De Senectute. Their friend-

ship is· commemorated in the
same author's De Amicitia.
corporis gratia: “ by the
charm of his person.'' L0ve
affairs with boys were scarcely
considered shameful among the

Greelts. Roman feeling was
nearer our own.

conciliatus: “ endeared.'’

3. et ipsum literally means
“ itself also,” but comes to be
little more than a variant of
quoque. The idiom is common
in Livy and later prose.

arguit: ‘⁴ confutes.’' In this
case, as in the other, Fenestella
was certainly right3 see on
nondum . . . annum (ᾗ ς).

4. Nepos: Cornelius Nepos,
a friend of Cicero and Catullus, '
a rather careless and inaccurate
biographer. From his worlts
twenty-live brief biographies
have come down to us.

aequales: “ of the same age.''
As a matter of fact, Terence was
about ten years older than Scipio
and Laelius (see f 5).

5. Porcius: Porcius Licinus,
in the first century rac, wrote
in verse a history of Roman
literature. This is not the only
chronological mistalre to be
found in the few extant frag-
ments of his work.

consuetudine: “ intimacy.’'
