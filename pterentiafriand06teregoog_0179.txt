APPENDix 177

258. The Mss. have huuc alter quis. This emendation of
Dziatzko’s‚ accepted by Klotz, Altrdmisclte Metrik 211, is re·
jected by Fairclough because he considers iambic ng impossible.
That form, however, occurs in 702, 864, and 967. In line 850 the
text is uncertain. For parallels in Plautus, see Klotz, Altrdmisclze
Metrik 52, and Lindsay, Tu Captivi os Plautus page 17.

277. Bentley read ut aim so as to get an accent on vim. The same
end may be attained by scanning aim ut.

300. Some students think that Pampilus remains on the stage,
and those who have felt that the stage should be vacant have made
him accompany Musis or enter his father's house. We must sup·
pose, however, that heis anxious to see and reassure Glucerium
after what Musis has told him; and no conllicting motive has been
provided hythe poet. Compare below on line 624.

337. Most editors adopt Bentley's emendation. He says:
Certe alterutrum legendum est, aut opus est scire aut opus suut ’
sciri. Posterius placet. I do not know of another example ol an

, infinitive alter opus suun but there seems to be no reason sor pre·
¹ ferring a passive infinitive to an active.

372. With Klotz Ι retain necesse, the reading of the Mss. and
Donatus. Most editors print necessus, because lachmann, on
Lucr. 6. 815, argued on the basis ol two passages (Heaut. 360, and
Eun. 998) that Terence always used that form before a consonant.

378. So Spengel, Fleckeisen, Tyrrell. Ι am unable to under-
stand Fairclough’s objection to altering lrabeat of the Ms·s.; it
represents a particularly easy corruption in view of the difference
between early and later Latin syntax.

412. That Burria enters from the right, not from a house repre·
sented in the scene, appears from line 414, huuc venientem sequor.
There seems to be no good reason for thinking that Carinus' house is ,
represented in the scene. ,

447. lt seems necessary to adopt with Fleckeisen Bentley’s
conjecture of the Plautine form aliquantillum in order to account for
aliquantulum, the metrically impossible reading of D and E. Most
editors read aliquantum with the other Mss.

449. Davos’ puerilest furnishes a satisfactory antecedent for
id (otherwise Schlee, ALL. 3. 556).
