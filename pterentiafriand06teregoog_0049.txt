INTRODUCTION

Quod illi maledictum vehemens esse existimant,
Eam laudem hic ducit maximam, quom illis placet,
Qui vobis universis et populi) placent,

Quorum opera in bello, in otio, in negotio

Suo quisque tempore usust sine superbia.

Videtur autem levius se defendisse, quia sciebat et Laelio et Scipioni
non ingratam esse hanc opinionem; quae turn magis et usque ad
posteriora tempora valuit. C. Memmius in oratione pro se ait,

⁴P. Africanus, qui a Terentio personam mutuatus, quae domi

himself in the third person in
his prologues.

1. quod: the antecedent is
eam in the next line. Each pro-
noun agrees in gender and
number with its predicate noun.

illi: i.e., isti malevoli.

2. quom illis placet is a
clauseoffact‚withquom,“that,'’
where classical Latin would
use quod; see H. & B. 553 3 cf.
L. & M. 860. Most scholars
regard quom as causal in this
use. “

4. opera: ablative singular
with usust.

5. suo tempore: “ athis con·
venience”; i.e., whenever it
has seemed best.

usust = usus est. 'For the
form, see on dictust (Andria 102).

sine superbia: “without dis-
dain''; i.e.‚ “since you have
not been above using their
assistance, why should l be? ”¹

6. Laelio et Scipioni: as we
have just shown, these were
not the naines that Terence had
in mind.

8. C. Memmius: a shifty
politician of Cicero’s day.
When he was governor of
Bithynia, the poet Catullus was
amemberof his staff. Although
Memmius certainly had little
sympathy with Epicurean phi-
losophy and was interested in
Greek rather than Latin litera-
ture, Lucretius dedicated to him
his philosophical poem, De
Rerum Natura.

9. personam: “mask.'' ΑΙ-
though masks were not worn by
Roman actors in Terence's time,

¹they were usual in Memmius'

day, and had always been worn
by Greek actors. Here “ bor-
rowed a mask’' is a figura-
tive way of saying “wrote
plays under another’s name.’'
