245. adeon = σάω-πῃ· l'or
the loss of the final short vowel,
see on intellextin (201). -adeon
hominem esse: for the infinitive
in exclamations, see A. &G. 462,

Β. 596, H. 616. 3, L. δι Μ’. 976.
—invenustnmz “ unlovely, un-
attractive.'' One might think
his trouble was quite the re·
verse; he has proved too at·
tractive to Cremes. But Pam·
pilus is in no mood for clear
thinking3 he 'uses the ordinary
phrases ol disconsolate lovers,
whether they fit the present
case or not.¹

247. Cremefis: the genitive
of Cremes is Cremi in line 368.
The accusative varies between

Cremetem (472) and Cremem
(361), and the vocative be-
tween Cremes (538) and Crem?
(550)-

248. hem: “all at once.”
See on 184.

²49 ff. Evidently Pampilus has
never seen Cremes’ daughter3
see on despondi (102).

²49· nisisi: this pleonasm is
rare in formal prose, but com-
mon in colloquial Latin. The
clause depends upon a nescio
which is implied as the answer
to the question Quam ob rem?

²5⁰· aliquid monstri = ali-
quod monstrum; the partitive
genitive depending upon a neu-
ter pronoun is very common in
Terence.

¹Muretus' way out of the difficulty, invenusts' dicebantur quibus Venus
in amoribus non faveret, gets no support from Donatus' gloss, sine venere, id
estsine gratia ; for that gives simply the ordinary meaning of the word
oenus. Donatus’ second explanation, cui displicens obicitur, is manifestly

ad lsoc.
