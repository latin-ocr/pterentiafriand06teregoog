¹26. The trobhaic octonarius contains eight feet. Diaere-
sis usually occurs after the fourth loot. This measure occurs
in only seven lines ol the Andria. The first is 245:

lldeon h6minem esse invenr'rstum aut infelicem quemquam,
(au-l (av ...l LulL ..llL-lL-l L

ut ego sum!
υΙύυ υ

27. ¹Os less importance are the few short iambic and tro-
chaic lines. The iambic quaternarius (from quaterni, “four
apiece”) may contain four lull feet, as in 176:

Verebar qu6rsum evaderet,
uLl- L Ι ..lesa

or it may be catalectic ( i.e., laclc the last half loot), as in 485 t

Date3 m6x ego hr'rc rev6rt0r.
υυ le Ll vll-

The hochaic quaternarius catalectic contains three and a half
feet, as in 246:

Pr6 deum atque hominum fidem l
L ul L υ vlL υΙΰ

28. Terence rarely employs other rhythms than the iambic
and the trochaic. The cretic tetrameter usually consists of
four cretics (Lv-). Either long syllable may be resolved
into two shorts‚ and a long syllable or two short syllables may
take the place ol the short in the first and third feet. Lines
626 and 629 are to be scanned thus:

Tanta vec6rdia innata quoiquam fit siet,
L υ ..lLu-le ..Ι L w·

I'dnest verum? lmmo id est gtnus hominum p6ssumum‚ in
