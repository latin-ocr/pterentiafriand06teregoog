Quietum mihi lamentari praeter ceteras

⁵ 122. formu: ablative.

1²3· honeste ac liberali:
“respectable and ladylike.''
Liberalis gets the meaning “ gen·
tlemanly, ladylike” from the
contrast with servilis.

124. esse: for the omission
of the subject, see on dictum
(29)-

125. percussit expresses more
surprise and anxiety than Eng-
lish ‘⁴ it struck me.”

126. lacrumae: usually
spelled lacrimae in classical
Latin. The sound of the

Δ vowel ol the penult was prob-

cll. A similar variation occurs
in lubet, libem optumus, optimus,-
columus, regimus, and in many
other words.

127. quorsum erudas:v indi-
rect question after timeo.

128. sepulcrum is often used
of the place where the body is
bumed.

clum contains the stem seen
iu eac-plri-or, “ try, test‚'’ and
peri-tus, “having tried, experi-
mented,’' and its meaning was
originally the same as that ol
cx-peri-mcntum, “ trial, test.''
The classical periculum comes
from this by the development
of a short vowel between c and
l, much as English “athletic'' v
sometimes comes to be pro-
nounced “atheletic.’' In other
words, too, early Latin often dif-
fers from classical Latin in the
form of this suffix3 Plautus and
Terence have vehiclum from ocho,
cubiclum from cubo, poclum for
