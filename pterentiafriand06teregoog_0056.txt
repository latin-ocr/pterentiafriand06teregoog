17. The most common verse in Terence is the iambis
senarius (from reni, “six apiece”), which contains six feet.
The last of these must be an iambus, but, since the linal
syllable of a Latin verse may be either long or short (syllaba
anceps), the pyrrhic (oo) may take the place of the iambus in
this one position. Many iambic senarii, but not all of them,
have a caesura before the ictus syllable of the third or fourth
foot. The first line of the Andria (numbered 28) is to be
scanned thus:

Vos istaec intro ausdrte3 abite. Sosia,
..Li-Li ,ΔΙ υΔΙυ let'e

To illustrate the proceleusmatic‚ we may analyne line 118:

l

Quae ibi aderant, forte unam as icio adulescentulam,
υ Ovi.. L! .. -ivv (κυΙ-έΙυύ

18. It will be observed thatin line 28 each ictus except

the last falls upon a syllable that has a word accent. The
early poets preserve, to a very great extent, harmony between
verse ictus and the accent of ordinary speech. In many
¹cases where the two seem to clash‚ it is because the accent 1
of the Latin sentence differed considerably from the word
accent which is described in our grammars. Thus line 29
runs:

Ades dum; paticis te volo. Dictt'rm puta:

Heredum is an enclitic and has the same effect upon the
accent as ·que. Similarly, τί volo is regularly accented on the
antepenult since the penult is short.

19. Latin words which form an iambus, such as deno, mli,
die, sire, are particularly hard for us to pronounce correctly.
The accent upon the initial short syllable makes it so diffi-
cultro preserve the long quantity ol the final syllable that
we tend to say cimel, me'i, etc.
