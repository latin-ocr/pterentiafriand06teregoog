ι INTRODUCTION

PLAUTUS

8. The earliest author from whom we have complete
Latin plays is Plautus, who was born in the little town of
Sarsina in Umbria on the Gallie frontier before 250 13.c., and
lived until 184 ne. He cameto Rome at an early age, and
got his first lessons in the drama as a stage carpentes or, it
may be, an actor (Gellius says, “in operis artificum scaeni-

n

corum ). later on he seems to have traveled, and he may l
have picked up a knowledge of Greek life at that time. Still, ἒ
his interest was always in'the Roman stage rather than in ÷
his Greek models. He usually chose comedies whose Ἴ
characters were painted with broad strokes, and whose Ῐ
incidente were novel or sensational. ln aword, he preferred η

the type of New Comedy which approached most nearly the
boisterous Old Comedy3 and he seems to have heightened
the colors and exaggerated the burlesque on his own account.
Twenty of Plautus’ comedies have been preserved. We
illustrate with some of the earlier scenes of the Aulularia or
The Hidden Treasure. ⁵

The situation at the opening of the play is explained by a
character who introduces himself quite ingenuously as a
Roman hearth god:

“That none may wonder who l am l'll tell you briefly.
l’m the Lar familiaris of this household from whose door
you saw me come. This house ,has for many years been my
dwelling and my care.''

The grandfather of Euclio, the present owner, had buried a
pot of gold and intrusted it to the hearth god, and then had
died. Since son and grandson had both neglected the wor-
ship of the Lar, the Lar had long refrained from disclosing
the treasure. But now at last, in reward for the piety of
his young daughter, Euclio has been permitted to find it.
