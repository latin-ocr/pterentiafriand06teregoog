So. Quid igitur obstat, cr'rr non liant? si. Audies.
Fere in diebus paucis, quibus haec acta sunt,

Beasti3 metui a Cruside.

of nutrio; semodius, “a half lor he is virtually one of them

peck,’' is from Jse[mi·]modius,·
vendo is from *oelnuln-do. ln
the same way dictu[s elst loses
a syllable. Similarly we have
such forms as Iocutu’s for lo-
cutuls els (202).

1⁰3· cur non fiant: a relative
characterizing clause3 the ante-
cedent of cur is quid. Trans·

' late “What's blocking the

way so as to stop it?”

104. fere . . . paucis:
“ approximately within a few
days ''; the tautology is collo-
quial-quibus is an ablative
of the time within which, used
where English idiom requires the
conjunction “ after.” The usage
occurs in Caesar, B. G. 3. 23, pau-
cis diebus, quibus eo ventum erat,
and elsewhere; see H. 488. 3.

105. haec: said with a gesture
indicating Glucerium’s house.

comments on the narrative ex-
press the fee‘lingsol the audience;

lar tole is often played by the
chorus in a Greek tragedy. -ibi
tum: both words mean “then'’;
the pleonasm is colloquial.

107. amabant: the imperfect
instead of the more logical
pluperfect is due to the common
tendency to speak of the re-
cently dead as if they were
still alive. “Burial will take
place from the late residence
of the deceased,’' runs the
obituary notice; but an ac-
quaintance who wants to attend
the funeral is likely to inquire,
‘⁴ Where does Mr. Blank live? ’'
—trequens2 an adjective,
where English idiom requires
an adverb.

109. conlacrumabat: “wept
with them.” ¹ — tum forecasts a
time when Simo would not ap-
prove of this act; translate “for ¹
the moment.’'-tr'im ld: for the
scansion, see Introduction 20.

¹Others think the compound is intensive, but the circumstances would
scarcely warrant bitror tears on Pampilus' part.
