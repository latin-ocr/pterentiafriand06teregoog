APPENDIX 1¹79

614. So D, and the reading is supported by the fact that the con·
text calls for an accent on me. P shows a repetition of the phrase,
nec quid me, with which the verse begins, and nec quidem me of the
other manuscripts is an attempted correction of that.

624. With some hesitation Ι follow Legrand's tentative sugges-
tion, Daos 486, in making this the end of an act, because I cannot
accept the alternative theory that lines 301-819, more than half
the entire play, 'were unbroken by a musical interlude. The poet
has indeed provided a satisfactory motive for getting Pampilus
and Davos off the stage: they have a difficult task before them,
and the time for accomplishing it is short. On the other hand, it is s
surprising to find the same two characters upon the stage again
eighteen lines below. The alternative supposition‚ however, that ἵ
Pampilus listened quietly to eighteen lines of undeserved insult
before making his confession, is ‘not satisfactory. Leo, Der Mono-
log im Drama 57, points out that both this break and theone after
line 300 are followed by the appearance of Carinus, one of the
characters said to have beeri added to the play by Terence3 per-
haps the division into acts was clearer in Menander.

the third foot (ό υ υ o -), but hesita'te to make any of the violent

changes usually adopted. Richard Klotz, Altro'misclze Metrik

298, suggests lominum genus pe'ssumum. Ι
631. The Mss. except·C and P read tempust, but Donatus com-

l ments on the absence of est.

713. All the best Mss. assign the second si quid to Carinus3 but ’
such a repetition seems inconsistent with his sanguine temperament.
Hence Ι adopt Spengel’s conjecture.

¹ . 751. The editors suppose that Musis’ exclamation is due to

Davos' rough attempts to force her to the right and away from

l Cremes. But any such stage business would be without motive

frorn Cremes' point of view and therefore impossible. Davos has
to rely upon whispers to get Musis away from Cremes.

754. It is easier to suppose that Musis used maledicis inexactly
for comminaris than to make Davos postpone an indignant question
