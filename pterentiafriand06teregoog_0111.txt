sonium is the Greek ὀψώνιον,

ence it rarely if ever corresponds
to Greek ὄψον, “ lish, sauce‚ rel-
ish‚” as the dictionaries say it
does. —ipsusz this early Latin
form is less common in Terence
than ipse. For the meaning of
the word, see on ipsa (265).

361. non cohaerent: “it

for the form, see on 247.

362. illo, an adverb of direc-
ti0n‚ shows the same termina·

colloquial Latin have also illd-c,

''‘ marketing, day's purchase of as well as the classical illuc. -

supplies.’' ln Plautus and Ter-

id: for the case, see A. & G.
