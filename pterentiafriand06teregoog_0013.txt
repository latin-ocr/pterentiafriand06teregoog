INTRODUCTION

THE ORIGIN OF COMEDY

1. The dramatic instinct is one of the most fundamental
and primitive of human characteristics. lt appears in the
young child's fondness for playing house and “dressing up.'’
It is, in fact, closely akin to the proneness exhibited by many
animals to imitate one another's eries. Among nearly all
primitive races mimicry forms an important part of dance
and ritual, and many peoples have gone so far as to give

regular performances for which more or less preparation has ’

been made.
ln only one country, however, so far as we know, has this =
primitive mimicry ever developed into a genuine form of
art. The literary drama is an original creation of the Greeks
alone; and yet they took the decisive step not once merely
but twice, since tragedy and comedy grew up independently.
Greek comedy originated in the songs and revels connected·
with the worship of Dionysus, god of wine. We cannot ¹
trace in detail just how and where mere rustic huffoonery
became gradually richer in content and more artistic in
form. Tradition connects the name of Susarion of Megara
with the later stages ol the process, and places him about
the middle ol the sixth century lac. Epicharmus of Sicily
had founded a genuine comedy by the end of the same
century. lt was in Athens, however, that comedy under-
went its final development and found a permanent home,
as tragedy had done before, The beginnings of a literary
comedy at Athens can be traced to the period of the Persian
warS.
