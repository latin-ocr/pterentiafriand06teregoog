number of the less obvious features of informal Latin will be
pointed out in the notes.

12. Still, the reader must not ascribe all differences from
Ciceronian Latin to the colloquial style. Terence wrote
about a century earlier than Cicero, and used a number of
forms and constructions which either went out of use entirely
or became rare by Cicero’s time. Peculiarities of early Latin
will also be discussed in the notes. ’

13. Our knowledge of Terence's life is based chiefly upon
the prologues to the plays, and a biography by Suetonius,
a scholar of the second century mn.

lt was the custom in Terence's day to precede the per-
formance of a comedy with the delivery of a prologue which'
gave the audience such information as is now conveyed by the
printed program: the name of the Greek play from which it

was taken, the name of the Greek author, the name of the
Roman poet who had composed the play, a statement of
where the scene was laid, and, in some cases, an outline of the
plot. Sometimes, too, a prologue contained criticism of
rival poets, or a defense of the author against such criticism.
Terence saw that this information‚ so far as it was necessary
and was not given in the formal announcement of the play
just before the performance‚ could and should be conveyed in
the dialogue of the play itself, and he did not prelix any pro·
logue at all to his first two plays at their first performance‚
His rivals, however, attacked him so fiercely that he found it
necessary to defend himself, and no other means seemed so
effective as the prologue. Seven of these prologues have been
preserved, two for the Hecyra and one for each of the other
plays; they give us much valuable information about the
historyof the Roman stage, and in particular about our
author’s artistic ideals aud methods.
