34 INTRODUCTION

Eucl. Thank you, Megadorus.

Meg. You’re looking very well indeed.

Eurl. [Aside] It’s not for nothing when a rich man speaks
so pleasantly to a poor man. 'l'he fellow knows already
that l've got gold3 that’s the reason for his kind “Good
moming.''

Meg. You anwed, aren'tyou?

Eucl. Not very, in money matters.

Meg. lf you look at the matter fairly, you have enough to
live comfortably on.

Eucl. [Aside] The old woman has certainly told him
about the gold: it’s as plain as day. I’m going right in
and cut off her tongue and dig out her eyes.

Meg. What are you saying to yourself? 1

Eucl. Complaining of my poverty. l have a grown-up

daughter who has no dowry; 1 can't marry her to any one. κ

Meg.¹ Hush! Take heart, Euclio. You’ll marry her off ;

l'll help you out; command me if you need anything.

Eucl. [Aside] His promising amounts to begging. He
has his mouth wide open for the gold. ln one hand he has
‘a stone while with the other he offers bread. l've no con-
fidence ina rich man who talks pleasantly to a poor man.
l know your octopuses that hold on to whatever they once
touch.

Meg. Listen a moment, if you are at leisure, Euclio, to a

request that l want to make of you for our common advan-
tage. , .

Eucl. [Aside] Dear me! He’s got his hook in my gold!
That’s what he wants to come to terms with me about, I'm
sure. But l'm going in and have a look. [Starts for his
house]

Meg. Where are you going?

Eucl. l'll be back right away; there’s somethingI must 1

look after in the· house,
