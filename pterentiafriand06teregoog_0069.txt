PROLOGUS

Contaimina'tri non decere fibulas.

Faciuntne intellegendo, ut nihil intellegant?

Qui quom hunc accusant, Naevium Plautum Ennium
Accirsant‚ quos hic noster auctores habet,

Quorum aemula'ari exoptat neclegentiam

Potius quam istorum obscriram diligentiam.

Dehinc [rt quiescant porro moneo et desinant

Male dicere, malefacta ne noscr'mt sua.

16. contaminari: “to be
mixed,” as Menander’s Andria
and Perinthia were mixed to
form Terence's Andria (see
Introduction 15). ’

17. faciuntne really means
“do they or do they not?”
Classical Latin, however, would
surely use nonne here, and
English idiom also requires “do
they not.”-faeiuntne . . .
intellegant: “Do they not
with all their knowing really
know nothing? '' or, better,
“Do they with all their know-
ing really know anything?'’

18. Naevium Plautum En-
nium: for Plautus, see Intro-
duction 8. Naevius was an
earlier contemporary ol Plau-
tus who wrote comedies and
tragedies, and, late in life,
an epic poem on the war with
Carthage, from which Vergil
is said to have borrowed not a
little. Ennius was a younger

contemporary of Plautus who
Ten. nuonrn— 5

wrote plays, but who is best
known for his epic poem on the
history ol' Rome from the land-
ing ol' AEneas in Italy down to
the poet’s own day. This was
regarded as the greatest Roman
epic until the appearance of
Vergil's AEneid.

1⁹· hic noster: sc. poeta; see
on 1. -auctorest “ examples
models.”

20. neclegentiam: “careless
freedom,” in the sense in which
we speak ol' a “free translation.'’
But perhaps we should translate
“ carelessness,” and think of this
and diligentiam in the next line
as quoted from Lanuvinus.

21. obscuram diligentiam:
“ obscure literalism,” or perhaps
“obscure accuracy.’'

22. dehinc: lor the pro-
nunciation‚ see on 79. - dehinc
porro: “ from now on.”

23. malefacta: originally a
phrase, male sacrun· see on
maledictis (7).
