74 reanum Annam

Sed postquam amans accessit pretium pollicens
Unr'rs et item a'rlter, ita ut ingeniumst bmnium
Hominum ab labdre proclive ad lubidinem,
Accepit condicionem, dehinc quaestum decipit.
80 Qui tum illam amabant, forte, ita iat fit, lilium
Perduxere illuc, secum ut r'rna esset, meum.

Egomet continuo mecum:

‘cene captus est;

Habet.' Observabam maine illorum servolos
Venientis aut abeuntis. Rogitabam ‘heus puer,
85 Dic sodes, quis heri Crr'rsidem ha'rbuit ?' nam Andriae

loquial than in lormal Latin.
Often they are weakened until
they scarcely differ in meaning
from th‘e primitive verb.

78. proclive: “ downhill ”3
be carelul to keep the metaphor
in your translation.

79. condicionem: “terme”
-dehincz pronounced deinc
with diphthongal ei, as regu-
larly in all periods of the lan-
guage; so deinde, dein, proinde,
proin contain diphthongs. The
spelling with a was retained be-
cause every one was conscious
that the compound contained
hinc. - quaestum: translate
“profession’' although qnae-
stus in its original sense is
nearer English “ trade ’¹ or “ oc-
cupation.” - occipit: an early
Latin synonym of incipit.

82. egomet: the use ol the
strengthened form ol the pro-
noun without marked emphasis

is' characteristic of colloquial
Latin. The omission of the
verb of saying is another collo-
quialism.

8³· hebet, iu the slang of the
arena, meant “he has his
deathblow.”-servolos: for the
diminutive, see ,on adnles-
centuli (55); for the spelling,
see on parvolo (3 ς).

84. rogitebem: see on qnaeri-
tans (75). Here the frequenta-
tive has its full force. - puer:
colloquial for serve, just as in the
Southern States “ boy '¹ formerly
meant “ slave '' (of any age).

85. sodes stands for si ααάισ,ι
the vowel ol si was elided and
on tended to become ὃ in collo-
quial Latin. The verb audeo
is a derivative of aeidns, and
in this phrase it retains its
original meaning “desire ”3
translate “if you please.'’—-
Crusidem: the classical form
