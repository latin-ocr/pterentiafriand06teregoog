ACTUS 1, SCENA I

Eorum obsequi studiis, advorsus nemini,

65 Numquam praeponens se illis -ita ut facillume
Sine invidia laudern invinias et amicos pares.

So. Sapic'3nter vitam instituit3 namque hoc tempore
Obsequium amicos, veritas odium parit.

Si. Interea mulier quaedam abhinc triennium

70 Ex flndro commigravit hi‘rc viciniam,
Inopia et cognatorum neclegentia
Coacta, egregia forma atque aetate integra.

So. Ei, vereor ne quid Andria adportet mali !

Si. Primo haec pudice vitam, parce ac duriter,

75 Agebat, lana ac tela victum quaesitans3

life all before her, in the prime
of life‚'' or, somewhat less ex-
actly‚ “in the bloom of youth.''

73. ei: the interjection.
