One kind of hiatus, however, is much more common in
Terence and the other early dramatists than in Vergil and
· his contemporaries. Accented monosyllables ending in a
long vowel orm are not elided before a short vowel, but
count as a single short syllable, as paldmunt (191), crim ἕο
(639),ἐῐε. Sometimes the syllable following such a mono-
