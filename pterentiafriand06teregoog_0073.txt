ACTUS 1, SCENA 1

Propterea quod servibas liberaliter.
Quod habui summum pretium, persolui tibi.
40 So. ln memoria habeo Si. Haud mrito frictum. So.

Gaudeo,

Si tibi quid feci aut facio quiid placeat, Simo,

Et id gratum fuisse advorsum te habeo gratiam. ’
Sed hoc mihi molestumst; narn istaec commemoritio
Quasi e'exprobra'atidst¹ inmeimori benefici.

personal pronoun had no accent3
that is, it was pronounced as an
enclitic. Hence this phrase was
virtually a single word with a
long, and therefore accented‚
penult. Cf. ade's dum (29), and
see Introduction 18.

38. servibas = serviebas; in
early Latin, verbs of the fourth
conjugation form the imperfect
indicative in -ibam or -iebam
—liberaliterr “in the spirit of a
free man.”

³9· pretium = praemium. -
persolui: the early Latin form
for persolvi.¹

40. Sosia prides himself upon
being a good and loyal servant.
In line 29 he tried to forestall a
reminder of his duty. Now the
same feeling leads him to inter-
pret Simo’s rehearsal of past
kindnesses as a reproof. His
tone shows vexation. Hence
Simo’s reassuring rejoinder.

42. id and the second syllable
of fuisse are shortened by the

iambic law; see Introduction 19.
—advorsumz the early form of
adversum. Advorsum te means
“before you”; translate “to
you.’'-habeo gratim, “I feel
gratitude,” is to be carefully dis-
tinguished from gratias ago, “l
thank you‚” and gratiam resero,
“l return the favor, retaliate.'’
43. hoe is shortened by the -
iambic law. —molestumst = mo-
lestum rst,· see the next note.
44. exprobratiost = exprobratio
rst‚· er and est after a vowel
become ’s and ’sr‚ and our manu-
scripts of Plautus and Terence
often indicate that pronuncia-
tion by the spelling. When -m
precedesestthe manuscripts give
such forms as molestumst (43),
although the pronunciation was
probably molesturt. —inmemoriz
dative after exprobratio; inearly ,
Latin, verbal nouns in -tr'o fre-
quently take the same construc-
tions as the verbs from which
they are formed—benefici: in
