THE ANDRIA

15. The Andria was the hrst play which Terence pro-
duced -the one he read to Caecilius at dinner, thereby
gaining that poet’s esteem (see §3 of Suetonius' Life os
Terence, p. 42 above). lt was in the main a translation of
the Andria of Menander. The latter play, however, seems to
have been virtually a second recension of the Perinthia,
which Menander had written early in his career3 and Terence
preferred to follow the earlier piece at some points. One of
these places, the ancient commentator Donatus tells us, was
the hrst act, which in Menander's Andria consisted of a
monologue by the old man, while in the Perinthia he was
represented as talking to his wife. Terence substituted a
freedman as the second character in the dialogue. Donatus
further tells us that the characters Carinus and Burria did
not appear in Menander's Andria, and it has been plausibly
suggested that Terence got them from the Perinthia.

This practice of combining two Greek plays to make one
Latin play, named contaminatio by the Romans, was severely
criticized by Luscius Lanuvinus and his school — chiefly, it
seems, because it hastened the day when there would be no
more Greek plays to translate. One might suppose that a
more valid criticism would be that a patchwork play would
be likely to lack coherence. No such objection, however,
can be urged against the Andria or any other of Terence's

plays.
