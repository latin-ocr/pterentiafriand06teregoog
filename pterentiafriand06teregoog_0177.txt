APPENDIX

33. Mss. and Edd.: eis. Here and in line 63 the verse requires
monosyllabic is or pyrrhic irs. Ι have preferred the former. Ter-
ence must have spelled the monosyllable eis (es was less usual), and
the copyists who modernized the other instances of ei into i would
almost certainly misinterpret eis as a dissyllable and therefore retain
lt.

58. So Mss. Fleckeisen and Fairclough transpose (ille lioru'm
nihil ille) out of deference to Schmidt's demonstration (Hermes
8. 478 ff.) that Terence ordinarily uses before vowels the plural
forms of lric with appended c(e). This consideration, however, is' .
more than overbalanced by the fact that the sentence accent is
seriously impaired by the transposition ; nil, not horum, is the
emphatic word. . “

70. lt is probable that lruc is from earlier *liei-ce, formed in the
same way as Greek ποῖ. lf so, it must have existed alongside of the
equivalent lroc, and editors of early Latin authors need not prefer
the latter against the Mss.

87. Mss.: tum simul, a reading which is possible if we assume a
false quantity by scanning Niceratum. See Spengel’s critical note.

103. The spelling cur of the Mss. of Terence is followed in this
edition. There is little doubt that the orthographies quor, qur, and
cur were current in the early period (see the statement of the evi-
dence in the Thesaurus), and it seems probable that the pronuncia-
tions quor and cir were both heard (for cair, cf. Anderson, ΟΡ.
4. 297), just as lroc and lrric were used side by side. Each passage,
then, should be considered independently on the basis of the manu·
script authority.

Editors who admit cur to the text of Plautus and Terence usually
admit also cum (conjunction), cuius, etc. The evidence for these
