close of the year 1905 there was discovered at Aphroditopolis
in Egypt, in the ruins of a private house of the Roman period,
a large jar full of papyrus manuscripts. For their greater
safety some leaves of an old boolr had been spread over the
top. The manuscripts in the jar were found to be in excellent
condition; they contained accounts. The sheets on top,
badly damaged and some of them lost, belonged to a copy of
several plays of Menander. It was possible to make out a
considerable portion of two of the plays and a smaller amount
of two others. Further fragments of one of the latter have
come to light in other parts of Egypt, and so we now have
from a third to a half of each of three of Menander's comedies.
The following is an outline of the Periceiromene or The Girl
with Slorn Locks.

The scene represents a street in Corinth with the fronts of
two neighboring houses. ln one of them dwell Pataecus, a
wealthy citizen, hh wife Myrrhina, and his adopted son
Moschion, whom Myrrhina has brought up as her son by a
former husband, although he was really a foundling. In the
other house live Polemon, a Corinthian soldier, and his
common-law. wife Glycera.

Polemon1 enters with his slave Sosias and tells him that
last evening, on his return from a campaign, he found his wife
in the arms of the young man next door. Bewildered by
what he saw and well aware of his own hot temper, he did not
make his presence known,butwithdrewtothecountry,intend-
ing to question Glycera this morning. The night has been
tedious and hehas beguiled the hours with overmuch drinking.

Sosias is sent to search for Moschion. Glycera comes
from the house just as Polemon is about to enter. She greets
him affectionately‚ and her manner shows no trace of a shame-
