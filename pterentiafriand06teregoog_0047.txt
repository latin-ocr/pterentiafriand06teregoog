venisset, dicitur initium quidem fabulae, quod erat contemptiore
vestitu, subsellio iuxta lectulum residens legisse, post paucos vero
versus invitatus ut accumberet cenasse una, dein cetera percucurrisse
non sine magna Caecilii admiratione. Et hanc autem et quinque
reliquas aequaliter populo probavit; quamvis Volcatius in dinume· s
ratione omnium ita scribat: ⁸

Sumetur Hecyra sexta, exilis fabula.

Eunuchus quidem bis die acta est meruitque pretium, quantum
nulla antea cuiusquam comoedia, id est octo milia nummorum ;

diles, as curatores ludorum solem· eutem means ‘⁶ and, and in-

uium, purchased plays and had
them presented at certain pub-
lic festivals.

ente = antea; i.e., before
they would decide whether or
not to purchase the play.

Caecilio: Caecilius Statius
was the leading comic poet of
the generation between Plautus
and Terence. His plays have
been lost except for a few lines
'that are quoted by later authors.
He died 168 13.c. For some
unknown reason the Andria¹
was not produced for sixteen
months or more after this
interview.

ad: “to the house of ”3 cf.
on ad (ξ 2). With cenantem
sc. eum = Caecilium.

1. fabulae: “play'’

3. percucurrisse:
through,’' i.e.‚ “read”

4. Caecilii: subjective geni-
trve.

“went

deed,” as it frequently does.

5. Volcatius: Volcatius Sedi-
gitus‚ ascholarof uncertain date,
wrote a work called· De Poetis.
The passages cited from it are
in iambic senarii (see lntroduc-
tion 17).

dinumeratione: as Volcatius
is known to have drawn up a
list of the comic poets ar-

ranged 'tn the order of their
merit (see on Naevio, etc„ ἐ 7),

it is not surprising that this
list of Terence's plays was so
arranged.

7. sumetur sexta: “shall be
chosen for sixth place.’' The¹
reason for putting the Hecyra
last is given at the end of the
verse.

8. Eunuchus: another of -
Terence’s plays. The title of a
play (fabula) is regularly treated
'as feminine.

9. nummorum = sestertium.
