176 APPENDIX

forms, however, is less strong than that for cur, and in this edition
quom, quoius, etc, are everywhere adopted.

There is equally good authority for reading with Spengel and
Fairclough : Quid obstat cu'r non ve'rae fiant? The context, however,
differs from that of line 47, where verae is appropriate; with this
passage we should rather compare 542 f.: ut . . . ita, uti nuptiae
fuerant suturae, fiant. Compare Ashmore, Appendix ad loc.

171. That Simo enters his house at this point, thus leaving the
stage vacant, is indicated by the following considerations: (1) Simo
would hardly say modo (line 173) of a conversation held not merely
before the opening of the play but before he had started to market
to purchase the day's provisions. (2) Davos’ monologue in lines
175 ff. seems to imply that he has just now learned of Simo's pro· “
fessed intention. His “l told you s0’'' (mirabar, uerebar) hardly
applies to news already an hour or so old. (3) Since in '226 f. Davos
is anxious to wam Pampilus before his father sees him, it is not
likely that he has already allowed a considerable time to pass before
starting on the errand. (4) Besides, he himself tells us that he ,
started to lind Pampilus as soon as he learned of the approaching
marriage (continuo, line 3 ς 5). (ς) The strongest argument of all is
that if Simo does not enter his house at this point, we must assume
that he starts back to the market at line 205 without having gone
indoors at all; forat his next appearance (404) he is returning from
the marlret. So Watson, PAPA. 42· lxxi. Leo, Der Monolog im
Drama 57, assumes that Simo enters his house here, but does not
cite the evidence. ‘ Ι

208. The sentence accent demands that we read mi orit rather
than me arft with elision. Compare lines 333, 349, 743.

226. On such final monosyllables as ut, see Vahlen, Uber die Vers-
sellusse in den Komddien des Terentius, and Sch511‚Rl.M. 57. 52 ff.

227. Leo, Der Monolog im Drama 57, suggests that this may be
the end of an act. But it is at any rate clear that there is no oppor-
tunity for a musical interlude; Musis must be seen by the audience
as soon as by Davos‚ since she comes from one of the houses repre-
sented on the stage.

236. The Ms. tradition and the etymology both favor the spell-
ing hoccinest.
