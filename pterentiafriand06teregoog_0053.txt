INTRODUCHON

Terenti nr'rm similem dicetis quempiam?

Volcatius autem non solum Naevio et Plauto et Caecilio, sed
Licinio quoque et Atilio postponit. Cicero in Limone hactenus

laudat:

Tu quoque, qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,
Conversum expressumque Latina voce Menandrum

ln medium nobis sedatis motibus effers,

Quiddam come loquens atque omnia dulcia dicens . . .

Item C. Caesar:

Tu quoque, tu in summis, o dimidiato Menander,
Poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator.
Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adiuncta foret vis

1. Terenti num, ete: the
verse is an iambic senarius. Te-
renti depends upon similem.

a. Naevio, ete: Aulus Gellius,
15. 24, quotes the passage in
full. In it the comic poets
are arranged in the order of
their metit as follows: Caeci-
lius, Plautus, Naevius, LiciniuS,
Atilius, Terence, Turpilius, Tra-
bea, Luscius‚ Ennius.

³· Limone: i.e.‚ Λειμών,
“meadow.” It'was a literary
criticism in verse, which has not
been preserved.

5. tu quoque, ete: these
verses and those quoted from
Caesar are hexameters.

7. in medium nobis effers:
properly, “you bring out into
our midst ”3 translate “you

produce among us.”
rrn. sunnin-4

sedatis motibus: Latin plays

are technically classed as sta· .

toriae, “ quiet, with little ac·
tion‚” and metonae, “full ol
action.” Terence seems to
have modified Menander in the
direction of the former type.
Translate “with less action.”

8. come: “gemel''

ιο. insummis: “in the first
rank.’'

12. atque is virtually equiva-
lent to atqui, as in Andria 225.

vis comica: the meaning
of the phrase is not clear. It ’
cannot refer to the boisterous
fun which was Plautus’ chief
stock in trade; for the com·
parison here is with Menander
who, like Terence, prefers humor
to horseplay. Perhaps Caesar
was thinking of the marvelous
