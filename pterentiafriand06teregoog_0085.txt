ACTUS 1, SCENA 1 ·

Prope adest, quom alirino more vivendfimst mihi:
Sine minc meo me vivere interez't m0d0.'

So. Qui igitur relictus est obiurgandi locus?

155· Si. Si propter amorem uxorem nolit ducere,

Ea primum ab illo animum advortinda iniuriast.

Et minc id operam do, ut per filsas nuptias

Vera obiurgandi causa sit, si deneget3

Simul sceleratus Divos, siquid consili

which gives dictust lrom dictu-
[s elst (see note on 102). Simi-
lar forms are promisti from
promilsipti, intellexti from in-
tellexisti (= intellechilstt), dixti
from dixisti (=dic[silstt).
Perfects shortened in this
way are very rare in formal
prose ol the classical period.

152. prope adest quom:
English idiom requires that we
insert a phrase such as “the
t'ime, the day‚” to serve as ante·
cedent of “when ” and as subject
of the main verb. - vivendumst
= nitendum est,· see on ex-
probratiost (44).

156. primum: “for the first
time ”3 so again line 936.-
animum advortenda iniuriast:
the phrase animum advorto
(classical nerto) is treated as if
it were a verb, i.e., in the active
it takes a direct object, and
this becomes the subject of the
passive (see G. 342, H. ἃ Β.

·160 Habet, tit consumat nunc, quom nil obsint doli.

391. 3). The phrase is often
written as one word, animad-
verto. ,

157 ff. Simo hopes that if he
can take his son to task when
he has the right clearly on his
side, he can get the boy away
from Glucerium. Then there
will beno obstacle in the way
of the match with Cremes'
daughter.

157. id: operam do, like ani-
mum advorto, is a phrase which
governs a direct object3 it is
equivalent to curo.

159. sceleratus: “ rascal.”
In the comedies the young
man’s body-slave is usually
ready to help him evade his
father’s wishes. -Davos = Da-
uus,· see on parvolo ( 5).

160. ut: in classical prose
the conjunction would normally
stand before sceleratus, at the
head of the clause, and that is
the most common arrangement
