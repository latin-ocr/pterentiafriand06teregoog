The early Romans were subject to this same tendency, so
much s0‚ in lact, that certain originally iambic words had
their final syllables permanently shortened. Eg5 was once

e⁹g5 like Greek ἐγώ; the adverbs ban? and mall? originally
ended in long ἑ, as do otheradverbs from adjectives of the-
first and second declensions3 m5d5, the adverb, is really
the ablative singular ol modus‚· the datives milri, tibi, sibl,
and the adverbs ibi and abi, originally had a long final syl-
lable,a pronunciation which was frequently employed by
Vergil and other classical puers, but which in their day may
no longer have been heard in ordinary speech.

In the time of Plautus and Terence the tendency to shorten
a long syllable alter a short was much more widespread than
the traces of the process in classical Latin would lead us to
suppose. Thus‚a syllable long by position might be short·
ened (dubit nemo); the two syllables might belong to different
words (a id gratum, Zgo ln portu, sine invidia), or they might
form only part of a word (vdlrlptati). An accent following the
long syllable of an iambus had the same effect as one preced-
ing it (vdldpta'ti, prldlcitia).¹ The tendency of early Latin to
shorten long syllables may, then, be summed up in these
two formulas:

(a) (²- tended to become (1 υ
(b) o -ἑ tended to become υ o&

The tendency was not equally strong in all words. The
common words which regularly show the shortening in later
times (see above) appear usually to have been pronounced
with this shortening in the early period, although, in the case
of most of them, there are sure instances of the original form
(note ego, Andria 258, ¹702 ; modo, 630, etc). Other words,
such as bonos, patris, regularly retained the long quantity;
